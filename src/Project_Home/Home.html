        <h2>Overview of FizX FP JME3 Helper Library</h2>
        <div>
            This library is built on jMonkey Engine Version 3.  You build easy physics based 3d games by extending a base application class containing many useful methods. The base application class holds references to manager classes, most of which have their own specialized control classes. The base application methods along with helpful public constants enable fairly rich 3d games to be made with minimal coding.

            The mission of this project is to further develop and distribute this helper library to encourage novice developers in their skill development and provide a forum where expert developers can share their experience.

        <h2>Some TODO's</h2>
        <div>
            Get 3D sound working in applet (Already tested and working in Windows executable.)
            <br>
            Stop some managers from extending Node class
            <br>
            Create gun weapon that puts effect at point of impact.
            <br>
            Incorporate more game states into library
